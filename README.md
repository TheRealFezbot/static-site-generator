# Static Site Generator

This was a project I did on boot.dev.

It creates a static site based on markdown.

To see a result on what this repo can generate go to https://therealfezbot.github.io/static-site-generator/


To use it, simply put any images and css files you want to use in the static folder. 
Put your markdown files in the content folder (replace or add to it)

You can change template.html if you want to use a different stylesheet.

Change build.sh to match your website / repo page.
Run it and push it and voila.
